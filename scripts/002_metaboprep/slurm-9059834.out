I. Setting up your pipeline
	-Your data directory is: /home/leem/001_projects/epic_somalogic_crc/analysis/001_phenofile/non-cancer/
	- Your metabolite data file is: proteins.txt
		Your metabolite data file was identified as a previously processed flat text file.
	- You have NOT provided a feature annotation file to process.
	- You have NOT provided a sample | batch annotation file to process.
	- Your declared platform is: Other
	- Feature filtering: Your declared feature missingness level is: 0.2
	- Sample filtering: Your declared sample missingness level is: 0.2
	- Sample filtering: Your declared total peak area filter level, in standard deviations from the mean is: 5
	- Sample outliers at features: Your declared that the interquartile range unit distance from the median of each feature to call a sample an outlier to be: 5
	- Sample outliers at features: Your declared that outliers, for the purposes of the PCA & PCA only, should be: leave_be
	- Metabolite independence: Your declared tree cut height is: 0.5

	- Sample filtering: Your declared principal component (PC1 and PC2) exclusion, in standard deviations from the mean is: 5
	- You have declared that a scatter plot, histogram, and table of summary statsitic for each feature in the data set should be written to pdf.

			* 0 features excluded for user defined missingness.
		- QCstep: estimate total abundance.
			- z-transformed data for total abundance estimation.
			- adding absolute minimum observed value to all values to make all values positive.
		- QCstep: exclude those features with TPA >= 5SD from the mean.
			* 8 sample(s) excluded for user defined TPA SD from the mean.
		- QCstep: re-identify independent features through correlation analysis and dendrogram clustering.
			- using currently QCd data.
		- Estimating the number of indpendent features.
			- Generating Correlation Matrix.
			- Generating Distance Matrix.
			- Constructing dendrogram.
			- Performing tree cut. Cut height defined at 0.5
			- Identifying independent features.
			* 3882 independent features identified.
		- QCstep: Perform Principle Componenet Analysis of currently QC'd data.
		- QCstep: Identify PC 1-2 outliers >= +/-5SD of the mean.
			* 8 samples excluded as PC outliers.
	b. Writing QC data to file.

VI. Estimating Summary Statistics on Filtered Data Set.
	a. Estimating summary statistics for Filtered samples
			- z-transformed data for total abundance estimation.
			- adding absolute minimum observed value to all values to make all values positive.
	b. Writing filtered sample summary statistics to file.
	c. Estimating summary statistics for filtered features.
		- Estimating the number of indpendent features.
			- Generating Correlation Matrix.
			- Generating Distance Matrix.
			- Constructing dendrogram.
			- Performing tree cut. Cut height defined at 0.5
			- Identifying independent features.
			- A total of 3901 independent features were identified in the total filtered data set.
	d. Writing feature summary statistics to file.
	e. Performing principle component analysis on final filtered data set.
		 The number of informative principle components:
			 1. Cattel's Scree Test : acceleration factor = 2
			 1. Parrallel Analysis = 96
	f. Re-Writing filtered sample summary statistics to file to include PCs.
	g. Writing PC statistics to file.
